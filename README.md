# banana-shaders
I was wondering how shaders work on Android and how an app should be structured to use them

This simple app loads two fairly large images and display them as 2 opposite sides of a rotating "card".
The card will continuosly rotate around the Y-axis while a slider provides a way to smootly rotate the card around the z-axis
A second slider provides a way to blend between the full-color and black-and-white rendering of the images
